# Conditionals
Setup:

{% highlight r%}
if (CONDITION) {
  EXECUTION
} else if (CONDITION) {
  EXECUTION
} else{
  EXECUTION
}
{% endhighlight%}

Simplified & vectorized `ifelse()`
{% highlight r%}
ifelse(CONDITION, TRUE_ACTION, FALSE_ACTION)
{% endhighlight%}

Switch can also be used:
{% highlight r%}
switch(VAR,
  opt_1 = {
    EXECUTION
  }, 
  opt_2 = {
    EXECUTION
  },
  opt_3 = {
    EXECUTION
  }
)
{% endhighlight%}

The code will execute different things depending on the value of $$VAR$$.

# Loops
Setup:

For loop:
{% highlight r%}
for (LOOP_VAR in SEQUENCE) {
  EXECUTION
  # more control
  break
  next
}
{% endhighlight%}

While loop:
{% highlight r%}
while(CONDITION){
  EXECUTION
}
{% endhighlight%}

# Functions
Setup:

{% highlight r%}
# simple function
FUNC_NAME <- function(PARAMS){
  EXECUTION
  # check for missing args - returns boolean
  missing(ARG)
  # invisible copy of object
  invisible(OBJ)
  # return object
  return(OBJ)
}
{% endhighlight%}

{% highlight r%}
# binary operators as functions
'%SYMBOL%' <- function(X, Y){}
# execute: x%s% y
{% endhighlight%}

## Pass undefined arguments 
We can allow for extra arguments that can be passed on to other functions. 

{% highlight r%}
f <- function(param1, param2, ...){
  EXECUTION
  # run another function with additional args
  func(...)
  EXECUTION
}
{% endhighlight%}

In addition, can also save extra args in a list
{% highlight r%}
list (...)
{% endhighlight%}

or use the nth unmatched argument
{% highlight r%}
..n
{% endhighlight%}

## Calling functions with a list of arguments
{% highlight r%}
do.call(FUN, NAMED_LIST)
{% endhighlight%}

## Find a function by name
{% highlight r%}
match.fun("FUN")
{% endhighlight%}

# Brief Overview of Data Structures

## Vectors
Vectors are one-dimensional arrays and can be generated with the function `c(...)`. 

Vectors can be various types: numeric, logical, character, or factor. All values in a vector must be one type. To change change a vector's type use the following functions `as.numeric()`, `as.logical()`, `as.character()`, `as.factor()`. Note that a factor are a way of representing categorical variables.

Some built-in R functions are vectorized, element-wise operations. Examples of these include arithmetic functions, relational comparisons, etc.

In R, objects are indexed starting from 1. For example, `x[1:5]`.

Some useful functions for vectors include `seq(from, to, by)`, `sample(x, size, replace, prob)`, `which()`, `%in%`, `order()`, `sort()`, `quantile()`, `cut()`, and `table()`.

## Matrices
Matrices are multi-dimensional arrays. They are generated from the function `matrix( c(...), nrow = , ncol = , byrow = )`. Vectors can be combined into matrices with the functions `cbind(...)` or `rbind(...)`.

Similar to vectors, arrays may be numeric, logical, or character, but it must be all one type. Matrices may also have vectorized functions. 

Matrices are indexed in similar ways, commas are used to separate the dimensions of matrices. For example, `m[1:4, 10:4]`.

Matrices can be multipled using `%*%` or divided using `solve(a, b)` (If b isn't supplied, `solve` computes the inverse). Additional functions include `t()` for the transpose.

## Data Frames
Data frames are two-dimensional structures where columns can be different types. To make a data frame use `data.frame(...)`, all columns of the data frame must be the same length. 

Data frames can be indexed and edited in similar ways to matrices. Here are a few examples `df[1:10, 3]`, `df[,2]`, `df$x`, `df[,"x"]`. 

Some useful functions to use with data frames include `dim()`, `nrow()`, `ncol()`, `head()`, `tail()`, `colnames()`, `str()`, `summary()`.

Data tables are an alternative to data frames that allow for optimized operations. They are available in `data.table` package. Data tables may differ from data frames in some indexing aspects.

## Lists
A list is the free-for-all data structure. It is like a data frame but is not limited by any length restrictions. Lists can hold any data structure, including other lists. To make a list use `list(...)`. 

Lists can be indexed by number `l[[1]]` or by name `l$apple`, `l[["apple"]]`. Unfortunately lists cannot be sliced, so to subset a list, loops should be used. See [Apply and Parallel Processing][apply_post]{:target = "_blank"} post.

## Special Values

`NULL` is a null object. To test whether an object is `NULL`, use `is.null()`

`NA` is a missing value. To test whether an object is `NA`, use `is.na()`
