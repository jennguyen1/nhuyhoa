Confidence intervals are used to convey the amount of uncertainty associated with a sample estimate of a population parameter. Data is collected and the results are used to generate a point estimate and a confidence interval. How does one interpret the confidence interval?

Say we generated a $$(1 - \alpha) 100$$% confidence interval. This interval means that if we were to replicate the data collection and analysis process many times, $$(1 - \alpha) 100$$% of the generated intervals would contain the true value of the population parameter. 

It is important to note that the true value of the population parameter is fixed, so any single confidence interval will either contain the population parameter or not. Thus we cannot interpret the confidence interval as the probability that the true value is in the interval.
