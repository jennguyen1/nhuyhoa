Welcome. My name is Jenny and I like numbers. I like being able to to take a garbled mesh of numbers and data to weave a cohesive story out of them. 

I am currently a 1st year graduate student at the University of Wisconsin Madison. I will write about the things I have learned as I embark on my studies. 

Please contact me with any questions, comments, or feedback. Thanks!
