```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(jn.general)
lib(data, viz)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5, fig.align = 'center')
library(faraway)
data(orings)
```

The output from glms in R are basically the same regardless of the link. Here we will look at an example output. 

```{r}
mod <- glm(cbind(damage, 6 - damage) ~ temp, data = orings, family = binomial)
summary(mod)
```

* Coefficient table: $$\hat{\beta}$$ estimates and standard errors, $$\hat{\beta}$$ are normally distributed
* Model Fit Statistics: deviances and AIC, deviances have $$X^2$$ distribution
* Fischer Scoring iterations: number of iterations in the IRWLS algorithm
